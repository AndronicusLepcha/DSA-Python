# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms in Python repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the Python programming language. Each implementation includes explanations and examples to help you understand the concepts better.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different categories, each containing implementations of specific data structures and algorithms. Below is an outline of the categories and the topics they cover:

- [Arrays](arrays/): Implementation of dynamic arrays, array manipulation, and related algorithms.
- [Linked Lists](linked-lists/): Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and common linked list operations.
- [Stacks and Queues](stacks-queues/): Implementation of stacks, queues, and their applications.
- [Sorting Algorithms](sorting/): Implementation of various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and more.
- [Searching Algorithms](searching/): Implementation of binary search, linear search, and related techniques.
- [Recursion](recursion/): Examples of solving problems using recursive techniques.
- [Link](recursion/):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2uO2nMT0Bk&t=9s
